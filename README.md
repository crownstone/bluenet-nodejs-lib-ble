# crownstone-lib-nodejs-ble

BLE module for the nodejs lib. This uses Noble for the BLE implementation.

# Work in progress!

This is the only nodejs module that is not in active use. It is not up-to-date with respect to recent packet definitions. Use the python [ble lib](https://github.com/crownstone/crownstone-lib-python-ble) for that.
